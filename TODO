Future posts
 * Metaclasses on metaclasses (Tower of metaclasses)
 * What is a class? (can't disassemble them)
 * When does a function bind? (do functions set in init bind? in new?)
 * What is the execution order of class definition, metaclass definition, and the __init__ and __new__ of each?
 * What is the evaluation order of __getattr__ and __getattribute__ for instances, classes, metaclasses, etc.?
 * What are the differences between list() and []? Example:
    >>> list([])
    []
    >>> list(('hi','bye'))
    ['hi', 'bye']
    >>> [[]]
    [[]]
 * Can't have a function act as a generator and normal function (via branch, etc.; can't return and yield in the same function.)
 * Can't inherit from code (types.CodeType).
 * Generator expressions vs list comprehensions: generator expressions get an extra closure
   * lambdas = [(lambda: i) for i in xrange(10)] vs. ((lambda: i) for i in xrange(10))
* Sorting a list of sets
   * the set is moved until there are no subsets to its right

Tooling
 * Import in a doctest-like format
 * Make an executable regression test of all the posts
